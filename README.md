# Chess Daily Stats to TickTick Bot

This project contains a Node.js script that automates updating a [TickTick](https://ticktick.com) task with your daily game statistics from [Chess.com](https://chess.com).

## Objective

The main goal is to fetch the number of chess games played on the current day and update a specific task in TickTick. This is useful for tracking daily goals, such as playing a certain number of games.

The bot will:

1. Fetch your daily games from the Chess.com public API.
2. Count the number of wins, losses, and draws.
3. Find a specific task in your TickTick account (e.g., "Daily Chess").
4. Update the task's status and add the game results to its content.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Task Content**: Rich, emoji-enhanced task descriptions with detailed chess statistics including points gained, percentages, and total play time.
- **Configurable Detail Levels**: Choose between brief mode (enhanced summary) or detailed mode (individual game listings with time, duration, opponent details).
- **Points System**: Automatic calculation of points gained (+1 win, +0.5 draw, 0 loss) with visual indicators.
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Win/loss/draw percentages alongside quantities for better performance insights.
- **Time Tracking**: Total daily play time calculated from individual game durations.
- **Intelligent Task Management**: The bot automatically handles task transitions between days by completing previous day's tasks when needed.
- **Time-Zone Aware**: Uses your configured timezone to determine when it's the "final" time of day to mark uncompleted tasks.
- **Automatic Task Creation**: Works with TickTick's recurring task feature - when a previous day's task is completed, TickTick automatically creates the next day's task.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Runs on a 30-minute interval with improved reliability to handle GitHub Actions scheduling constraints.
- **Execution Monitoring**: Enhanced logging to track execution times and identify potential scheduling issues.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing task content formats.
